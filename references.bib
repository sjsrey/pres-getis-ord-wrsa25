  abstract = {In 2016, Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election by securing a very large share of the rural vote. In the 2020 election, his margin of victory in rural America was even greater. This time, however, voter turnout in urban areas was much higher, an even larger share of these urban voters cast their ballot for Biden, and Trump lost the election. Analysis revealed that two variables were especially important predictors of county-level voting behavior. Counties that Trump won had a large proportion of non-Hispanic white residents and a low proportion of college graduates. When controlling for other independent variables, the effects of rural/urban residence largely disappeared. Thus, Trump's dominance in rural counties is explained by the fact that rural counties have large numbers of non-Hispanic white residents and lower levels of educational attainment than urban counties. These same variables were important in explaining the vote in five key battleground states. The relevance of these findings for the future of U.S. democracy in an era of deep political division is discussed.},

Our results show that regional variations in affective polarization are best explained by a current rural--urban divide and by how regions have performed economically in the last years. We also show that geographical proximity matters and reinforces the effects of economic deprivation.},

The main theorem uniquely characterizes a class of polarization measures that fits into what we call the "identity-alienation" framework, and simultanously satisfies a set of axioms. Second, we provide sample estimators of population polarization indices that can be used to compare polarization across time or entities. Distribution-free statistical inference results are also used in order to ensure that the orderings of polarization across entities are not simply due to sampling noise. An illustration of the use of these tools using data from 21 countries shows that polarization and inequality orderings can often differ in practice.}

  abstract = {Several recent studies have suggested that the distribution of income (earnings, jobs) is becoming more polarized. Much of the evidence presented in support of this view consists of demonstrating that the population share in an arbitrarily chosen middle income class has fallen. However, such evidence can be criticized as being range-specific--depending on the particular cutoffs selected. In this paper we propose a range-free approach to measuring the middle class and polarization, based on partial orderings. The approach yields two polarization curves which, like the Lorenz curve in inequality analysis, signal unambiguous increases in polarization. It also leads to an intuitive new index of polarization that is shown to be closely related to the Gini coefficient. We apply the new methodology to income and earnings data from the U.S. and Canada, and find that polarization is on the rise in the U.S. but is stable or declining in Canada. A cross-country comparison reveals the U.S. to be unambiguously more polarized than Canada. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

In the United States, the rural health disparity has been a recent focus of attention and made a priority for improvement.

This paper briefly reviews some available definitions of urban and rural for American geographic subunits and their respective strengths and weaknesses. For example, some definitions are better suited than others for capturing access to health care services. The authors applied different definitions to breast cancer incidence rates to show how urban/rural rate ratio comparisons would vary by choice of definition and found that dichotomous definitions may fail to capture variability in very rural areas. Further study of the utility of these measures in health studies is warranted.},

  abstract = {The main contribution of this paper is to clarify some of the misconceptions about income polarization indices observed in the existing literature. Our analysis explores the domain of measures of polarization of the income distribution, with a specific emphasis on elucidating the importance of distinguishing between bipolarization and multipolarization measures. Additionally, we assert that a valid polarization metric must adhere to the principle of scale-invariance. Furthermore, in cases where the income distribution is categorized into relatively poor and relatively rich, a valid bipolarization measure should consistently increase when regressive transfers occur from poorer to richer individuals and when progressive transfers occur between two poorer or two richer individuals. The study identifies instances where bipolarization measures that fail to adhere to these criteria have been employed in previous research, leading to erroneous conclusions. The research also provides a succinct analysis of the challenges faced by scholars in employing Esteban and Ray's multipolarization measure and its adapted versions. Artificial numerical examples are used to illustrate the application of different polarization measures in various scenarios. Additionally, a real-world illustration is presented that depicts a declining trend of the bipolarization of income distribution in Brazil from 2001 to 2015, coinciding with a decrease in inequality during this period. The study concludes by pinpointing errors in previously published works.},

We provide evidence that spatial cleavages have increased dramatically since the mid-twentieth century. At no point since the Civil War have partisans been as clustered within the boundaries of individual states as today. Nonetheless, even when geographic sorting is measured at the precinct level, differences across communities tend to be significantly smaller than differences within.

Using large-sample surveys combined with aggregate demographic and election data, we find that national-level differences across racial groups explain 60\% of the variation in district-level voting patterns, whereas geography explains 30\%. Black voters consistently choose Democratic candidates across districts, whereas Hispanic and white voters' preferences vary considerably across geography. Districts with the highest racial polarization are concentrated in the parts of the South and Midwest. Importantly, multiracial coalitions have become the norm: in most CDs, the winning majority requires support from non-white voters.

We apply classical and spatial Markov chains to measure spatial income dynamics and we employ a decomposition of spatial inequality to measure spatial polarization. In doing so, we ask the following questions: Has spatial inequality increased across Mexican municipios since 2000? What has been the role of place mobility in any changes in overall spatial inequality? Finally, we examine what the main components of place mobility have been over this period. We find evidence of a strong spatial dependency between municipios that has increased over time but we find no clear pattern at the state scale. Intra-state municipal inequality has relatively declined while Inter-state municipal inequality polarization has increased. We also find clear evidence that transitional dynamics of municipio incomes are influenced by spatial context. Substantial evidence shows that municipio income mobility is driven by a growth component that could be likely reflecting the devaluation of the peso over this period. Exchange mobility is found to be a more important component of overall place mobility than dispersion (inequality) mobility.},

Poor development prospects and an increasing belief that these places have ``no future''---as economic dynamism has been posited to be increasingly dependent on agglomeration economies---have led many of these so-called ``places that don't matter'' to revolt against the status quo. The revolt has come via an unexpected source: the ballot-box, in a wave of political populism with strong territorial, rather than social foundations. I will argue that the populist wave is challenging the sources of existing well-being in both the less-dynamic and the more prosperous areas and that better, rather than more, place-sensitive territorial development policies are needed in order to find a solution to the problem. Place-sensitive development policies need, however, to stay clear of the welfare, income support and big investment projects of past development strategies if they are to be successful and focus on tapping into untapped potential and on providing opportunities to those people living in the places that ``don't matter''.},

From a graph theoretic point of view, a cluster graph is a vertex-disjoint union of cliques. The clustering problem is the task of making the fewest changes to the edge set of an input graph so that it becomes a cluster graph. We study the complexity of three variants of the problem. In the Cluster Completion variant edges can only be added. In Cluster Deletion, edges can only be deleted. In Cluster Editing, both edge additions and edge deletions are allowed. We also study these variants when the desired solution must contain a prespecified number of clusters. We show that Cluster Editing is NP-complete, Cluster Deletion is NP-hard to approximate to within some constant factor, and Cluster Completion is polynomial. When the desired solution must contain exactly p clusters, we show that Cluster Editing is NP-complete for every p⩾2; Cluster Deletion is polynomial for p=2 but NP-complete for p{$>$}2; and Cluster Completion is polynomial for any p. We also give a constant factor approximation algorithm for a variant of Cluster Editing when p=2.},
