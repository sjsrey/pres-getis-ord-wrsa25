Why is it important
:::

## Wolfson

\begin{equation}
P_W = (2G_B - G) \frac{\mu}{m}.
\end{equation}
where $G_B$ is the Gini index of inequality between the two halves, $G$ is the Gini index for the entire distribution, $\mu$ is the mean of the distribution, and $m$ is the median.
Letting $L(p)$ be the ordinate of the Lorenz curve at the $p_{th}$ percentile, the discrepancy between perfect equality and the Lorenz curve at the median is: $D_{50} = 0.5 - L(0.5)$.
Given that $G_B = D_{50}$, the Gini index can be rewritten as
 $G=G_B + G_W$
 with  $G_W$ representing inequality within the two halves of the distribution. This implies the polarization index is:
\begin{equation}
P_W = (G_B-G_W)\frac{\mu}{m}.
\end{equation} 

## Components of Bipolarization

- *Increasing spread*: gap between the two halves
- *Increasing identification*: decrease in local variance

:::{.notes}
add two sets of figures to demonstrate these components

point out that identification in the case of a transfer from Musk to Trump would work to reduce inequality (variance) but increase polarization

## Multipolarization 

:::{.notes}

:::

- Division into $k$ ordered groups
- $\pi_i= N_i /\sum_i N_i$
- $\mu_i$ is the relative mean income of group $i$

$$
P_{ER} (\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \pi_{i}^{\alpha+1} \pi_j \left| \mu_i - \mu_j \right|
$$

The parameter $\alpha$ is the degree of sensitivity to polarization. When $\alpha=0$, $P_{ER}(\alpha) = 2 G_{B}$, where $G_B$ is the Gini index between groups.

##  Spatial Polarization
$$
I(y) = \sum_{g}^K w_g I_g + I(\mu_1 e_1, \mu_2 e_2, \ldots, \mu_k e_k)
$$

where

w_g =
\begin{cases}
    f_g \left( \frac{\mu_g}{\mu} \right)^c & \text{if } c \neq 0, 1 \\
    f_g \left( \frac{\mu_g}{\mu} \right)   & \text{if } c = 1 \\
    f_g                                   & \text{if } c = 0.
\end{cases}

$I_g$ is the inequality in group $g$, $\mu_g$ is the mean of incomes for members of group $g$ and $e_g$ is a unity vector with $n_g$ elements, and $f_g=\frac{n_g}{n}$. The parameter $c$ measures transfer sensitivity. For $c < 2$, the measure is more sensitive to transfers in the bottom of the distribution than to those in the top end of the distribution. When $c=1$ or $c=0$ the [cite/text/c:@theil1972StatisticalDecomposition] measure is obtained.

## Spatial Polarization

The measure of spatial polarization is  the ratio of the between-group inequality over the within-group inequality:
$$
P_{ZK} = \frac{ I(\mu_1 e_1, \mu_2 e_2, \ldots, \mu_k e_k)}{\sum_{g}^K w_g I_g }.
$$

The polarization can thus grow with increasing distances between the average incomes of the regions as well as a decrease in the inequality within the regions.
